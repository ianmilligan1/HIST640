</div>
Digital history, the application of new and emerging technologies to the study of history, is an important field that has begun to reshape historical production and scholarship. This graduate level course introduces students to the literature on digital history, and then puts theory into practice by digitally collecting, publishing, and producing new historical knowledge with cutting-edge tools.

Critical topics for this course include:
<ul>
	<li>What is digital history, and what is its relationship to the digital humanities and the broader field of history?</li>
	<li>How can new technology transform historical work, including introductions to:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Data mining and textual analysis</li>
		<li>Spatial histories</li>
		<li>Data visualization</li>
		<li>High-performance computing environments</li>
	</ul>
	<li>How are digitized primary sources transforming the study of history?</li>
	<li>How can we put history online and reach new audiences?</li>
</ul>

Meeting in a hybrid format -- half sycnronously, the other half asyncrhonously --- this course takes a hands-on approach to these methods. While the reading load is lighter, this is made up by an expectation that students come to class prepared.

This class is a hybrid class. 

There will be one, 60 to 90-minute maximum synchronous meeting per week via Microsoft Teams. As we would "normally" be meeting for two or three hours a week, the remainder of the time will be either enaging with pre-recorded content, readings, or peer-generated content.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/131">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
