This week we will focus on two main things:

* What ethical concerns arise when we begin to work digitally? What does it mean to _digitize_ a document that might have previously only been read in a reading room?
* What ethical concerns do the new wave of born-digital documents bring? What obligations do we as historians have?
* How does this differ or is it similar to our ethical obligations as oral historians, or as historians working with the records of the long-deceased?

## Our Discussion for this Week

In advance of the class, consider the following prompts:

* What are research ethics?
* What approach have historians taken towards research ethics and access?
* How is this being changed or challenged by the digital age?
