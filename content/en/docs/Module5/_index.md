This week we will focus on two main things:

* What ethical concerns arise when we begin to work digitally? What does it mean to _digitize_ a document that might have previously only been read in a reading room?
* What ethical concerns do the new wave of born-digital documents bring? What obligations do we as historians have?
* How does this differ or is it similar to our ethical obligations as oral historians, or as historians working with the records of the long-deceased?

The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide). 

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

* Kimberly Christen, "Opening Archives: Respectful Repatriation," _The American Archivist_, vol. 74, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2011): 185-210. Available via Library Access.

## What is it?

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include: 

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/examples/): Check out some example code!
