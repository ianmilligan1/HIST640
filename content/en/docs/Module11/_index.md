We will hold final presentations on 26 March 2021 and 2 April 2021. This will be similar to an **online, virtual conference.** 

Notably, to make it fair, you will have to upload a 10-minute presentation by the start of class on March 26th. I will play them in the class, and then you will do live question and answer (this is both to ensure we have smooth connections and also to be fair to those who present on the second day).

If you haven't done a video recording, don't worry. I'll provide information here well in advance.

## What's going on??

See the [Assignments](/assignments) page for more information. We'll also talk about this in class.
