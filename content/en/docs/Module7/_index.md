**Content Warning**: I am using the case studies of the September 11th, 2001 attacks this week. The articles contain straightforward descriptions of the attacks, but I do want to flag that the television archive can make for some harrowing viewing. Watch at your comfort level.

This week we do two things:

* Explore the role that historians have played in responding to breaking events, using the case study of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks; and
* Put thought into practice to collaboratively develop plans to document contemporary events in Canada.

## Readings for this Week

* James B. Gardner and Sarah M. Henry, "September 11 and the Mourning After: Reflections on Collecting and Interpreting the History of Tragedy," _The Public Historian_, Vol. 24, No. 3 (Summer 2002): 37-52.
* Michelle Caswell, "Instant Documentation: Cell-Phone-Generated Records in the Archives," _American Archivist_, vol. 72, no. 1 (Spring-Summer 2009: 133-145).

## Homework for the Week

After the discussion, we will carry out a small group assignment – in groups of two or three students (we'll talk about why teams are important), you will pick an ongoing event in Canada and develop a rough two-page working document. It will cover:

* **Brief description of the event** (half page)
* **Online collection strategy** (one page)
* **Ethical considerations** (half page)

This will be due before (i.e. up to and including the minute we connect to the seminar together!) the next week's class.

## Our Discussion for the Week

In our discussion, we will cover the following topics:

* **September 11th, 2001**. How did historians and museums respond in the weeks and months after the events to keep a record? Have they been successful? What strategies do you find most compelling? If the attacks are not in your own living memory, how do you understand them today?
* **Event collecting**. How would we approach a topic like this today? We will discuss the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as one avenue.
