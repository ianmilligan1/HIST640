This is the **choose your own adventure week**! What does that really mean? We'll talk in the weeks before, but basically, is there something you want to learn about that we haven't covered in the course? 

This could include:

- more programming?
- video games?
- new narrative approaches?

The sky is the limit, so we'll talk about this as the course evolves. Basically, this is a week where we can be flexible and have some fun.
