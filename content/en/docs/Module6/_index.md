## Our Discussion for this Week

In our discussion, we will cover the following topics:

* **What is spatial history?** What have projects done with this method? 
* **Take your most recent research project and think about what a spatial approach would add.** Come up with a mockup – on paper is fine – about what it might look like. What might you map? What issues would you run into? Would a spatial approach add to the project or not? 

See you all then!
