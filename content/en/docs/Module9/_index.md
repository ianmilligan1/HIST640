## Want to Meet with Me?

As always, you can book a 30-minute meeting with me via Calendly. Use this link [here](https://calendly.com/i2millig/30min). If there are no times that are available, just send me an [email](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca) and we can work something out. 

This will create a Microsoft Teams appointment. The URL for the Teams link will be in the calendar invitation e-mailed to you.
