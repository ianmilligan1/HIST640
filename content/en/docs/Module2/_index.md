This week we do two things:

- Gain a basic understanding of the history of digital history; and
- Begin to think about the various ways historians have used the Web to engage with new and emerging publics.

## Homework for the Week

The main task this week is to set up a class website for HIST 640. This can be part of your digital portfolio. You can do so on a variety of sites, including Wordpress or Wix, to whatever level of technical complexity you would like.

To help you with this, I will provide a video walking you through the basic approach to setting up a site. 

Before the class, you should have a site set up with the following components:

* An "about" page;
* Another page with a CV; and
* Either a page of content with some project information *or* a blog post introducing yourself.

If you run into trouble, we'll talk a bit about any pitfalls as a group during the discussion. 

## Our Discussion for this Week

In our Microsoft Teams discussion, we will cover the following topics:

* **History of digital history**. Come prepared to discuss the following points:
	* How has digital history evolved over the last 50 years? What is new? What has remained the same?
	* How does digital history differ from the "digital humanities," based on what we have learned from this module and the last one?
	* Are you hopeful about the future directions of digital history? Where do you see it going.
* **The History Web**. How are historians engaging with the public?
	* Why do we do this?
	* What has worked?
	* How will you incorporate what you think has worked into your own website?
* **Setting up your course blog**. We don't want our class to become a technical support forum, but we'll talk a bit about the best approaches to join the history web with your own site.
