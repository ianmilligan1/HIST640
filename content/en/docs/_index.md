**Welcome to HIST 640**. This will be the main place that you interact with course content. 

Note that it is laid out in **modules**. At the start of January, each module will contain the _readings_ assigned. However, I will be adding in videos as each module opens up, etc.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Every week, _before_ our asynchronous meeting you should make sure to:

- read the assigned material;
- watch any videos and read the summary material; and
- carry out any other assigned tasks.

Every Monday morning, _I_ will make sure to:

- send you all one e-mail with a reminder of what's to come this week; and
- provide any connectivity links;

The reading load is lighter than your average Tri-University class. _However_, as a digital history class with an applied bent, sometimes there will be additional activities that will take the place of this reading load: i.e. trying out a website, installing some software, watching a video, or trying something that might be outside your comfort zone.

The latter is key: parts of this class should and will be new to you all. This is a good thing as it helps us learn! But if you're feeling overwhelmed or have questions, always [e-mail me](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca) and we can connect there or set up a live chat.
