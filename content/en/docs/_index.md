**Welcome to HIST 640**. This will be the main place that you interact with course content. 

Note that it is laid out in **modules**. At the start of January, each module will contain the _readings_ assigned. However, I will be adding in videos as each module opens up, etc.

You can also chat with each other in the Microsoft Teams space that we've opened up. We'll learn how to use that in Module 1.

Every week, _before_ our asynchronous meeting you should make sure to:

- read the assigned material;
- watch any videos and read the summary material; and
- carry out any other assigned tasks.

Every Monday morning, _I_ will make sure to:

- send you all one e-mail with a reminder of what's to come this week; and
- provide any connectivity links;

The reading load is lighter than your average Tri-University class. _However_, as a digital history class with an applied bent, sometimes there will be additional activities that will take the place of this reading load: i.e. trying out a website, installing some software, watching a video, or trying something that might be outside your comfort zone.

The latter is key: parts of this class should and will be new to you all. This is a good thing as it helps us learn! But if you're feeling overwhelmed or have questions, always [e-mail me](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca) and we can connect there or set up a live chat.

## Want to Meet with Me?

As always, you can book a 30-minute meeting with me via Calendly. Use this link [here](https://calendly.com/i2millig/30min). If there are no times that are available, just send me an [email](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca) and we can work something out. 

This will create a Microsoft Teams appointment. The URL for the Teams link will be in the calendar invitation e-mailed to you.
