**Admit it**: almost everything you learn you learn via Google. How does it shape your worldview?

This week, we do two main things:

* An introduction to the basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning. What are they? Why should historians care?
* An introduction to algorithmic bias and critical approaches to this field. How do machines reflect the biases that we inscribe on them?

Artificial Intelligence has impacted many aspects of daily life. We are witness to new cultural forms ranging from gaming devices to companion robots. We have seen exponential growth in the automation of jobs, from the manufacturing to the service sector, and the consequent displacement of human labour. It is clear then that the socio-cultural and political impacts of such trends deserve our attention -- as students, scholars, policy makers, and practitioners.

## Readings for this Week

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

## Homework for the Week

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include: 

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Our Discussion for this Week

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/examples/): Check out some example code!
