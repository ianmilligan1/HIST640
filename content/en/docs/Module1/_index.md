Welcome to HIST 640! This week is an introduction, focusing on the following:

* Introducing you to the syllabus and this course website. What do you need to know to succeed in the course.
* Getting to know each other, and how we can use the connectivity services we're using in HIST 640.
* I will call on each of you during the synchronous meeting to do the following:
	* Introduce yourself and what your MA MRP/Thesis is hopefully going to be about;
	* Why are you interested in digital history?
	* What do you hope to get out of the course?

## Readings for this Week

No readings for the week. You should watch the welcome video before hopping in.

## How to Connect

One of the unique challenges of the Tri-University Graduate Program is that we are all on different campuses, some of which use Zoom and some of which use Microsoft Teams. There is an element of "on the fly" thinking that we will use to coordinate this course.

Since I do not want to have an open link out on the Web, all of you will have received via e-mail an invite for the synchronous component of the class. 

You should **download Microsoft Teams** [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app). It is a _free_ download for your desktop or mobile. You do not need to have a Microsoft account, and you can join as a guest if you want.

## Using Microsoft Teams

Part of the "homework" for this week is getting set up. I'd like you to join the Teams group and in the **general** channel post a quick hello to the class. Try responding to others.

You can also use the **random** channel or create your own (or direct message each other) if you want to talk about your favourite television shows, socially-distanced hangout places, etc. etc.

## Want to Meet with Me?

As always, you can book a 30-minute meeting with me via Calendly. Use this link [here](https://calendly.com/i2millig/30min). If there are no times that are available, just send me an [email](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca) and we can work something out. 

This will create a Microsoft Teams appointment. The URL for the Teams link will be in the calendar invitation e-mailed to you.
