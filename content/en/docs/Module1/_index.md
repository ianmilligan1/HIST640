## Readings for this Week

No readings for the week. You should watch the welcome video before hopping in.

## How to Connect

One of the unique challenges of the Tri-University Graduate Program is that we are all on different campuses, some of which use Zoom and some of which use Microsoft Teams. There is an element of "on the fly" thinking that we will use to coordinate this course.

Since I do not want to have an open link out on the Web, all of you will have received via e-mail an invite for the synchronous component of the class. 

You should **download Microsoft Teams** [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app). It is a _free_ download for your desktop or mobile. You do not need to have a Microsoft account, and you can join as a guest if you want.
