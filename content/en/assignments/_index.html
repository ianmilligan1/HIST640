<h1 class="text-center">This course has five marked items.</h1>

<p class="text-center font-weight-light">As you can see from the assignment breakdown on the <a href="/about">syllabus</a> or below, this course has ongoing participation coupled with a short introductory essay and then a final project. My goal is to be flexible to let you study what you want to study, as well as make sure you get some feedback on the first assignment before we get to the final one! If you have questions, as always, let me know â€“ <a href="/covid">in light of COVID-19 I am more flexible than ever</a>.</p>
